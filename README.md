🚘 The Rise of the Truck
Data Storytelling Project — U.S. Auto vs. Light Truck Sales
Overview

This project explores the long-term evolution of U.S. motor vehicle sales, comparing automobile and light truck trends over several decades.
Created as part of a Data Storytelling course, the goal was to transform sales data into a clear narrative that communicates economic and consumer shifts through effective visualization and presentation design.

Objectives

Compare sales patterns between automobiles and light trucks.

Identify key turning points and external factors influencing vehicle sales.

Use visualization and storytelling to communicate insights to a general audience.

Data

Source: U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) / Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED)

Variables: Year, Vehicle Type (Automobiles, Light Trucks), Monthly Sales (in millions of units)

Period Covered: ~1970–2023

Key Insights

🚗 Automobile sales have gradually declined since the late 1990s.

🚙 Light truck sales have surged, overtaking autos as the preferred U.S. vehicle category.

📉 Both markets experienced sharp downturns during recessions (2008–09, 2020).

💡 The overall trend reflects a consumer shift toward SUVs, crossovers, and trucks as dominant vehicle types.

Visual Storytelling Approach

The presentation leverages:

Clean, minimalist charts comparing Auto vs. Light Truck Sales

Consistent color schemes for clarity

Limited text emphasizing key takeaways

A smooth flow from historical data → trend visualization → interpretation

Tools Used

Power BI / Excel / PowerPoint (visualization and presentation)

Python (optional): pandas, matplotlib, seaborn for preprocessing and plotting

Design tools: Microsoft PowerPoint
